# Item Response Distribution Bar Chart

Creates a faceted bar chart showing the response distribution for each
item, with counts and percentages displayed on each bar. Each item gets
its own panel, with response categories on the x-axis and percentage of
responses on the y-axis. This is a descriptive data visualization tool
intended for use before model fitting.

## Usage

``` r
plot_bars(
  data,
  item_labels = NULL,
  category_labels = NULL,
  ncol = 1,
  label_wrap = 25,
  text_y = 6,
  viridis_option = "A",
  viridis_end = 0.9,
  font = "sans"
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame in wide format containing only the item response columns.
  Each column is one item, each row is one person. All columns must be
  numeric (integer-valued). Response categories may be coded starting
  from 0 or 1. Do not include person IDs, grouping variables, or other
  non-item columns.

- item_labels:

  An optional character vector of descriptive labels for the items
  (facet strips). Must be the same length as `ncol(data)`. If `NULL`
  (the default), column names are used. Labels are displayed as
  `"column_name - label"`.

- category_labels:

  An optional character vector of labels for the response categories
  (x-axis). Must be the same length as the number of response categories
  spanning from the minimum to the maximum observed value. If `NULL`
  (the default), numeric category values are used.

- ncol:

  Integer. Number of columns in the faceted layout. Default is 1.

- label_wrap:

  Integer. Number of characters per line in facet strip labels before
  wrapping. Default is 25.

- text_y:

  Numeric. Vertical position (in percent units) for the count labels on
  each bar. Adjust upward if bars are tall. Default is 6.

- viridis_option:

  Character. Viridis palette option for the count text color. One of
  `"A"` through `"H"`. Default is `"A"`.

- viridis_end:

  Numeric in \\\[0, 1\]\\. End point of the viridis color scale for
  count text. Adjust if text is hard to read against the bar colors.
  Default is 0.9.

- font:

  Character. Font family for all text. Default is `"sans"`.

## Value

A [`ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html)
object.

## Details

Each item is displayed as a separate facet panel with the item label in
the strip on the left side. Bars are colored by response category using
the viridis palette. Each bar shows the count (`n = X`) as text.

**Input requirements:**

- All columns must be numeric (integer-valued).

- The data frame must contain at least 2 columns (items) and at least 1
  row (person).

## Examples

``` r
{
library(ggplot2)

# Basic response distribution plot
plot_bars(eRm::pcmdat2)

# With custom item labels
plot_bars(
  eRm::pcmdat2,
  item_labels = c("Mood", "Sleep", "Appetite", "Energy")
)

# Two-column layout with wrapped labels
plot_bars(
  eRm::pcmdat2,
  item_labels = c(
    "General mood and emotional wellbeing",
    "Quality of sleep at night",
    "Appetite and eating habits",
    "Overall energy level during the day"
  ),
  ncol = 2, label_wrap = 20
)

# With custom category labels
plot_bars(
  eRm::pcmdat2,
  category_labels = c("Never", "Sometimes", "Often")
)
}

```
